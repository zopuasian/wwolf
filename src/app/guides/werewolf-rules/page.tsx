    answer:
      "Traditional Werewolf requires 7-15 players plus a moderator. However, with Wolfcha, you can play solo against AI opponents with 8-12 total players in a game. This makes it perfect for practicing strategies or enjoying the game when you can't gather a group.",

  {
    question: "What is the difference between Werewolf and Mafia?",
    answer:
      "Werewolf and Mafia are essentially the same game with different themes. Mafia (created in 1986) uses a crime family theme, while Werewolf (introduced in 1997) uses a supernatural village theme. The core mechanics - hidden roles, night kills, and day voting - are identical. Many players use the terms interchangeably.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do Werewolves win the game?",
    answer:
      "Werewolves win when they equal or outnumber the remaining villagers. For example, if there are 2 werewolves and 2 villagers left, the werewolves win because they have achieved parity and can control the vote.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when you're eliminated?",
    answer:
      "When eliminated (by voting or night kill), your role is revealed and you can no longer participate in the game. In some variants, eliminated players can give 'last words' before being removed. You cannot communicate with living players after elimination.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can the Seer check the same player twice?",
    answer:
      "Yes, the Seer can check any living player each night, including ones they've checked before. However, this is usually inefficient since you already know that player's alignment. It's better to gather new information.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if there's a tie during voting?",
    answer:
      "Tie-handling varies by ruleset. Common approaches include: no elimination (the tied players survive), a runoff vote between tied players, or the Sheriff/Mayor breaks the tie. In Wolfcha, tied players enter a PK (player kill) speech round before a revote.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Werewolves kill each other?",
    answer:
      "Yes, Werewolves can technically target their own teammates, though it's almost never strategically beneficial. This might be used as an extreme gambit to appear innocent, but it significantly hurts the wolf team's chances.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a typical game last?",
    answer:
      "A typical Werewolf game lasts 15-45 minutes depending on player count and experience level. Games with 8 players tend to be shorter (15-25 minutes), while 12-player games with experienced players can extend to 45 minutes or more.",

            Werewolf is a party game for 7-15+ players that pits an informed minority (the werewolves) against an uninformed majority (the villagers). Created by Dimitry Davidoff in 1986 as &quot;Mafia,&quot; the game gained its werewolf theme in 1997 and has since become one of the world&apos;s most popular social deduction games.
